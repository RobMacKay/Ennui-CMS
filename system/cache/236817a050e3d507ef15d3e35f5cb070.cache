It  was developed by Jason Lengstorf of Ennui Design, with help from Drew  Douglass of Ennui Design and Envato.</p>
<h3>Why Bother?</h3>
<p>The ECMS was built because existing content management systems  weren't doing the job the way we felt it should be done. No bloat, no  extra modules, just content management. No extensive back-ends, just  editing controls. A simple but powerful plugin system to allow for  non-standard functionality easily and with minimum development.</p>
<p>The result is a lightweight, easy-to-use, powerful content management  system that has the out-of-the-box functionality to allow the less  computer-savvy to use it right away, but the extendability to allow  developers to easily bend it to their will &mdash; no hacking or ugly  workarounds required!</p>
<h3>Status</h3>
<p>ECMS is currently in its alpha stages, but should be ready for a  public beta by the end of 2010.
